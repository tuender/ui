# tuender

Tuender is a set of ui components and other util functions which comes handy for Angular development.

We use storybook to preview our components. You can run the following command from root to access them:

```
pnpm run storybook
```

## Testing

Tuender has jest tests. Run the following script locally from the root:

```

```

## E2E Testing

We use cypress to run against storybook previews.

pnpm run e2e
```
